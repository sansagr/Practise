*problem statement*

*requirements*

- The stadium has 4 sections 
- Each section has n seats
- Each section has different prices for seats
- a person can reserve a seat in any section of their choice
- they can also cancel the reservation
- there a limit on the number of seats that can be assinged per section
- once assigned the seat cannot be assigned to anyone else
- the guest should be able to check the availability of seat


*scribbling*

- write a class that will generate random number of seats for a section(between 20-50)
- write a class that will generate random number of sections for a stadium (between 4 - 7)
- reserving a seat results in an invoice that has amount mentioned 
- you can process the payment using 2 types (cash, credit card)
- admin can list the reserved seats along with the guests assined to those seats
